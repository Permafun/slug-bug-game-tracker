# SlugBug Frontend Tracker

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This is a simple score tracker made with React, used for Slug Bug (or however your parents called it). This tracker is the frontend for a MERN stack application, handling the user interactions when creating, updating, and/or deleting games.

### This is under construction
